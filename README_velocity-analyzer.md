# Overview of Seismic (Velocity) Analyzer

This scripted R function performs a simple operation
on a text file to present basic statistical info 
of a shear-wave velocity model I generated from 
past research ('xline_twt_model.txt').

The function accepts only one argument - the text file - 
and proceeds to generate a contour plot of the 
processed velocity model and a summary of statistical 
info of the model
