# Welcome to Subsurfacesee...

This repo offers a lot of what I am currently working on and learning 
about in terms of data retrieval, processing, and visualization. Most
code herein is Python, MATLAB, and R. 

Also, this repo continues to develop and be editted to ensure easy-to-understand
instructions and navigation for past/current users and visitors. Upcoming
content will relate to using machine learning to extract more info
from complex geoscientific data I continue to analyze.

If you have comments/questions
regarding any of the content, please message me at any time!
