# Welcome to Subsurfacesee [MATLAB]!

This repo offers a lot of what I am currently working on and learning 
about in terms of data retrieval, processing, and visualization. Most
code herein is Python, MATLAB, and R. If you have comments/questions
regarding any of the content, please message me at any time!

This section offers some MATLAB code I have written and am still developing
that relates mainly to geoscience and specifically geophysics.
