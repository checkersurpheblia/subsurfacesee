# A Velocity File
This text file was generated from geophysical technique called 
'velocity analysis' - go here to figure out what that means:
https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Velocity_analysis

Now, note that the first column is TWT (or two-way-travel-time) in seconds.
In case you don't know that term or concept, it refers to the 
total time taken for an elastic seismic wavefront to travel
down through the earth - in this case no more than 30 - 50 meters -
and back to the surface where ground motion is recorded by geophones
(or in the case of marine data acquisition, hydrophones).

The remaining columns correspond to root-mean-square velocity (which 
we estimate from velocity analysis). These are shear-wave velocities,
by the way. With all these data, we have what is called a 2-D
velocity model! Take a look at or quantitatively analyze it for 
yourself, it's quite interesting!
