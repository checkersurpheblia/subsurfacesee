The two (post-stack) SEG-Y files here are data acquired from past research. Have a look at them 
if you have a way to read SEG-Y files! If you have trouble loading it, please contact 
me at anytime. The two SEG-Y files are the following:

1) All_CMP_xLINE_D2_stacked_FK_tmuted_tpow_n10pr_twind.su_1_ampt.su.sgy
2) All_CMP_inLINE_D2_stacked_FK_tmuted_tpow_n10pr_twind.su_1_ampt.su.sgy

Note that these data were acquired via SH-SH seismic reflection method. If you 
want more info regarding these data (and much more like it), view my Master of 
Science thesis document here:
